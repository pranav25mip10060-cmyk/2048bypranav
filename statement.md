This project is a Python implementation of the classic 2048 game using the turtle graphics module. 
It demonstrates grid-based logic, tile merging, keyboard interaction, and basic GUI rendering. 
The goal is to recreate the 2048 game in a simple, beginner-friendly way without using external libraries.<img width="1470" height="936" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-25 at 2 27 17 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97076859-0b7e-40d9-b202-c63c432b386e" />
